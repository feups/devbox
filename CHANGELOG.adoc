### box configuration

The previous `params.sh` file has been replaced by two files:

    - `config/box` (box parameters)
    - `config/ad` (active directory credentials)

[TIP]
====
- You will be warned beforehand if a configuration file is invalid.

- The key `boxUserStacks` replaces the previous `user_stack` field and accepts a list of stacks.
====

## v2.5, 11/02/2017

- Add `taffybar` a new status bar for xmonad.

The previous xmobar status bar is still available via `ln -sf xmonad-xmobar.hs ~/.xmonad/xmonad.hs`.

## v2.4, 23/01/2017

[WARNING]

====
While doing `vagrant provision` you might encounter an error related to an incompatible version of `local-configuration.nix`.
Indeed `vagrant provision` don't override that file as it might contain personal settings.

Please ensure that `/etc/nixos/local-configuration.nix` does not contain any `zsh` settings (these settings have been moved to `configuration.nix`). The file should look like https://github.com/CIRB/devbox/blob/master/system/local-configuration.nix + your personal settings.

If you need help, please join the `devbox` slack channel.
====

- Update `cicd-shell` to 0.9.7

## v2.3, 04/01/2017

As an example, if you set in `params.sh` 'user_stack=fmx', the puppet repository for `fmx` will be cloned in `~/projects/cicd/puppet/fmx`.

```
