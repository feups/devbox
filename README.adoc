TIP: Have a quick look at the <<Troubleshooting>> section before to get started.


## Software requirements

- Virtualbox 5.1.x
- Vagrant 1.8.x

Please do update if you have older release(s).


## Quick first time setup

====
Within the os host, create a new folder of your choice. You might call it `devbox`. We will use the term `ROOT_DIR` to refer to this folder in the next paragraphs.
====

### ssh keys

1. in the `ROOT_DIR`, create a directory `ssh-keys`.
2. in this ssh-keys subfolder, copy your `Bitbucket` key pair, rename them 'cirb_rsa' and 'cirb_rsa.pub' respectively if the filename differs.
3. in the ssh-keys subfolder, copy your `Github` key pair, rename them 'cirb_github_rsa' and 'cirb_github_rsa.pub'. If you use the same key pair, copy the previous pair and rename accordingly.
4. in `ROOT_DIR`, copy the https://github.com/CIRB/devbox/blob/master/user/params.sh[params file] to automate your personal setup (your credentials, the clone of your stack, the git config,...).
+
WARNING: To preserve the original encoding of the file (`unix` and not `Windows`) do not copy/paste from Github UI. Instead, download the https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CIRB/devbox/master/user/params.sh[template] using `wget` or `curl`. As an alternative, you can just verify and change the file encoding within the editor of your choice. This file is read from within the `devbox` and  we want avoid unwanted characters such as `CR LF`.

### box import

Open a terminal in the `ROOT_DIR`. You might want to use 'Git bash here' if you have a git client on your Windows host.

To download the base box from our CIRB repository:
```
vagrant box add devbox http://repo.irisnet.be/boxes/devbox.box <1>
```
<1> You can also use 'devbox-novagrant.box' and maintain a Vagrantfile locally

To initialize the box, in `ROOT_DIR` do:
```
vagrant init devbox && vagrant up
```

[NOTE]
====
- Always verify that the cable of the VM is connected as virtualbox (mainly older versions but has appeared with 5.1.2 too) has a bug not starting the network interface. If so, you will have to *connect the cable*. See <<Troubleshooting>>
- Do not interrupt the process. The first time it might take a while to update and fetch all the required components.
- In case any issue arises, please use the `#devbox` slack channel and ask for help.
====

When `vagrant up` terminates, restart your box in order to finalize your first time setup using:
```
vagrant reload
```


## Usage

### vagrant

```
# shutdown the vm
vagrant halt
# boot the vm
vagrant up
# update configuration
vagrant provision
# destroy the box (all local state is lost)
vagrant destroy
```

The provisioning is done automatically the first time `vagrant up` is executed. It is safe to provision on a regular basis using the `vagrant provision` command on the host. This will bring new features listed in the <<_changelog>>. In case of a major version bump (which is expected two or three times a year), the box should be destroyed and downloaded again.

[NOTE]
====
Provisioning is separated into two steps: `system` to configure the system and `user` to configure the vagrant user. You can selectively ask for provisioning using:

```
vagrant provision --provision-with system
vagrant provision --provision-with user
```
====

### operating system

The devbox is based on https://nixos.org/[NixOS] version 16.09. NixOS is a Linux distribution based on the https://nixos.org/nix/[nix] package manager.

The whole system setup is declared in https://github.com/CIRB/devbox/blob/master/system/configuration.nix.

To clean-up the store (whenever the disk usage is too high) use:

```
→ sudo nix-collect-garbage -d
```

### windows manager

The devbox comes with a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiling_window_manager[tiling windows manager] called http://xmonad.org/[xmonad]. Such a minimal approach has been chosen for 3 reasons:

* Efficiency: the box needs to consume as minimum CPU/Mem resources as possible
* Simplicity: the window manager is basic but yet quite flexible
* Practicality: the desktop is distraction free.

### terminal emulator

The `devbox` uses the `urxvt` terminal for its speed and customization.

|Command | Description

|kbd:[<Control> <Meta> p]|Change theme

|kbd:[<Meta> <s>] |Search console output
|kbd:[<Control><Meta> c/v] | Copy/paste to/from clipboard
|=====

The default shell is `zsh` which allows for predictable history and completion.
You can revert to using `bash` as your default shell if you wish by removing all zsh related lines in the `/etc/nixos/local-configuration.nix` file.

You might want to enable some `oh-my-zsh` plugins by updating your zshrc. None has been enabled by default to avoid unwanted intrusion. See https://github.com/PierreR/dotfiles/blob/a8e45029767a22998f7a68fdf114297255495d0e/.zshrc#L3[here] for one example.


### projects

If you set a value for `user_stack` in the `params.sh` file, the puppet `mr` file for your stack will be activated for you. That means that the source for puppet for your stack will be automatically cloned into the puppet project directory (`~/projects/cicd/puppet/$stackname`).

If you don't set the value, there will be no project on the box. You will need to enable some `mr` repositories associated with your `hostgroup`.

For instance, for the `bos` hostgroup, you would do the following:

```
→ cd .config/mr/config.d
→ ln -s ../available.d/puppet-bos.mr .
→ ln -s ../available.d/salt-bos.mr .
→ cd
→ mr -f up <1>
```
<1> you usually don't want to automatically update such repository on provisioning. That's the reason behind the `-f` (force) flag.


### cicd

You can use a semantic name as a `dns` to lookup any machine known by `puppetdb`. The pattern to use is: #$subgroup.$role.$hostgroup.zone.cicd#.

For instance if you want to connect through ssh to the `bos` jenkins slave, you can (inside the devbox) use:

```
→  ssh -i ~/.cirb_rsa username@jenkins.slave.bos.prod.cicd
```

In general you don't need to connect to nodes to manage, query or orchestrate them. Have a look at the <<_cicd_shell>> section to learn how to use the `cicd` command line utility.

For puppet help, go to the <<_puppet>> dedicated section.

## Customization

### system

You can add some specific configuration by editing `/etc/nixos/local-configuration.nix`.
For instance if you want to install the `geany` package, just uncomment the adhoc line in `local-configuration.nix`.

After changing the `local-configuration.nix` file, rebuild `nixos` by using this command line:

```
→ sudo nixos-rebuild switch
```

TIP: To avoid losing your customization after a `vagrant destroy`, copy `/etc/nixos/local-configuration.nix` into `/vagrant` on the boxfootnote:[The ROOT_DIR of the host is automatically mounted to /vagrant on the box given the box is started with `vagrant up`.]. If such a file exists on the ROOT_DIR of the host, it will be used the first time a box is provisioned and won't be overridden by a call to `vagrant provision` later on.

WARNING: More drastic changes such a changing the window manager is only possible via `/etc/nixos/configuration.nix`.

### user

#### params

You can tweak some default settings such as "do I want to install the geppetto plugin" by modifying the `user/params.sh` file. In order to do so, copy the https://github.com/CIRB/devbox/blob/master/user/params.sh[file] to the host where the `Vagrantfile` sits. You can easily do this by using this command line on the box:

```
→ cp /tmp/user/devbox-x.x.x/user/params.sh /vagrant/params.sh
```

`vagrant provision` will automatically configure your global `.gitconfig`, if you add your `user.name` and `user.email`:

.params.sh
```
user_name="John Doe"
user_email="jdoe@cirb.brussels"
```
WARNING: Don't separate `=` with spaces

#### dotfiles

You can add any `dotfiles` repositories including your own personal ones thanks to https://github.com/RichiH/vcsh[vcsh/myrepos].

For instance you might easily add/share some `vim`, `tmux` or `zsh` configurations.

To share simple dotfiles configuration, for instance let say you want to share a default `.zshrc` file for the devbox, you can simply add the file to the https://github.com/CIRB/devbox-dotfiles[CIRB dotfiles repositry]. The file is now part of the default CIRB dotfiles source repository and will be pushed on the devbox at the next provisioning.

If you want to share a non trivial, external or optional configuration, you can use or create a specific source repository for it and register the repository https://github.com/CIRB/vcsh_mr_template/tree/master/.config/mr/available.d[here].

If you want the configuration to be active by default, you then add a link to it in the SCM, just like https://github.com/CIRB/vcsh_mr_template/blob/master/.config/mr/config.d/dotfiles.vcsh[this one]. On the other hand, if you want it inactive by default, you would ask the interested users to make the link themselves on their box.


Eventually there is a third option. Some of your configurations are personal and there is no need for them to be shared inside the CIRB organization. You normally won't need that option but it is there for flexibility sake. 3 steps are required:

1. Fork https://github.com/CIRB/vcsh_mr_template[mr CIRB template]
2. Change the https://github.com/CIRB/vcsh_mr_template/blob/master/.config/mr/available.d/mr.vcsh#L2[mr pointer] to it.
3. Change the `mr` pointer on your local box. As an example, you might follow this command line:

```
→ vcsh mr remote set-url origin git://github.com/PierreR/vcsh_mr_template.git
```

As a note, if you want to override the CIRB dotfiles completely you can replace https://github.com/PierreR/vcsh_mr_template/commit/82708255d904beffe53b9587e8f553aa8804cc37[the pointer to the dotfiles]. In order to keep such a setting after a `vagrant destroy`, you would copy the `user/params.sh` to `/vagrant` and change the `mr_template_repo_url` value.

For more information about `vcsh`, https://github.com/RichiH/vcsh/blob/master/doc/README.md#from-zero-to-vcsh[Look here].

#### local packages

If you need a package in 'user space' (and you are not interested in sharing such configuration), you might prefer the more imperative approach:

```
→ nix-env -i geany
```

You can quickly search for packages online at https://nixos.org/nixos/packages.html[nixos.org]


## How is the box generated ?

The box is generated using packer and the source files from https://github.com/zimbatm/nixbox[here]:

```
packer.exe build nixos-x86_64.json <1>
vagrant box add devbox-x.x-pre packer_virtualbox-iso_virtualbox.box
```
<1> be careful of keeping the linux file encoding while working on windows !

The size of the 'pre box' is ~ 300M

The box is then repackaged to a full vm:

```
git clone git@github.com:CIRB/devbox.git
cd devbox
vagrant up --no-provision
vagrant provision --provision-with system
vagrant reload
rm -rf /tmp/system # on the future packaged box
vagrant package --output devbox-x.x.x --vagrantfile Vagrantfile
```

The size of the repackaged vagrant box is ~ 2G.


[[Troubleshooting]]
## Troubleshooting

Ssh-key with passphrase::
+
Using cirb ssh-keys with a passphrase will currently cause difficulties with `mr`, a tool we use to handle git repositories in a declarative way. It will prevent some of the automation to go through (nothing critical though). If possible, please regenerate a pair of keys with no passphrase and register them in stash.cirb.lanfootnote:[We will improve the situation in a future release if it is tagged as a major concern.].

Virtualbox 5.0.x::
+
For some host OS, Vagrant does not start its network interface. You will need to manually go to menu:Machine[Configuration > Network] and ensure the box "Cable Connected" is checked.
This issue has also been encountered with virtualbox 5.1.2

For Windows 10 users::
+
Everything usually just works on Windows 10.
That said, keep in mind that various issues have been reported concerning incompatibilities between `hyper-v` and `virtualbox`. It is likely that such compatibilities arise again after a windows or virtualbox update.
+
We will try to offer a hyper-v compatible box using `packer` (no virtualbox) in the future. Packer has just announced such a support. Stay tune.
+
In the meanwhile, if you face such a issue you will have to disable hyper-v to get a working devbox. Please proceed as follow:
+
[lowerroman]
. disable hyper-v
. use virtualbox as hypervisor
. install the docker tools based on a virtualbox machine.

NOTE: The only use of hyper-v we have detected so far is by the latest version of *Docker for Windows*.


## Life cycle

Tickets and issues are handled directly on https://github.com/CIRB/devbox/issues[Github issues]. Alternatively you might want to use http://jira.cirb.lan/browse/CICDPROJ-150[Jira].

Question, support, discussion are handled in the slack `#devbox` channel.

The versioning scheme used is semantic: `major.minor.patch`. A major jump implies some incompatible changes likely from the `vagrantFile` and forces to:

[lowerroman]
. destroy the old box losing all current statefootnote:[The README describes several tricks to keep/store your customization.] : `vagrant destroy`
. remove the old box: `vagrant box remove devbox`
. add the new one: `vagrant box add devbox http://repo.irisnet.be/boxes/devbox.box`
. initialize the new box: `vagrant init devbox && vagrant up`

Please look at the https://github.com/CIRB/devbox/blob/master/CHANGELOG.adoc[Changelog] for more information.

The devbox will be maintained continuously with at least a major release every six months to follow the OS life cycle.
